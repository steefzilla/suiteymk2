# Suitey Rust Example Project

This is a sample Rust project for testing Suitey's platform detection capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `Cargo.toml` - Package configuration
- `src/lib.rs` - Library source code with unit tests
- `tests/integration_test.rs` - Integration tests

## Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

This project demonstrates:
- Cargo.toml-based project detection
- Unit tests in `src/`
- Integration tests in `tests/`
- Suitey should detect this as a "Rust project with high confidence"
